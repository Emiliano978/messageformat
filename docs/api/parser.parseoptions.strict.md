# ParseOptions.strict property

By default, the parsing applies a few relaxations to the ICU MessageFormat spec. Setting `strict: true` will disable these relaxations.

**Signature:**

```typescript
strict?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

- The `argType` of `simpleArg` formatting functions will be restricted to the set of `number`<!-- -->, `date`<!-- -->, `time`<!-- -->, `spellout`<!-- -->, `ordinal`<!-- -->, and `duration`<!-- -->, rather than accepting any lower-case identifier that does not start with a number.

- The optional `argStyle` of `simpleArg` formatting functions will not be parsed as any other text, but instead as the spec requires: "In argStyleText, every single ASCII apostrophe begins and ends quoted literal text, and unquoted {<!-- -->curly braces<!-- -->} must occur in matched pairs."

- Inside a `plural` or `selectordinal` statement, a pound symbol (`#`<!-- -->) is replaced with the input number. By default, `#` is also parsed as a special character in nested statements too, and can be escaped using apostrophes (`'#'`<!-- -->). In strict mode `#` will be parsed as a special character only directly inside a `plural` or `selectordinal` statement. Outside those, `#` and `'#'` will be parsed as literal text.
