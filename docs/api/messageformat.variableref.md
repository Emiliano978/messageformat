The value of a VariableRef is defined by the current Scope.

To refer to an inner property of an object value, use `.` as a separator; in case of conflict, the longest starting substring wins. For example, `'user.name'` would be first matched by an exactly matching top-level key, and in case that fails, with the `'name'` property of the `'user'` object: The runtime scopes `{ 'user.name': 'Kat' }` and `{ user: { name: 'Kat' } }` would both resolve a `'user.name'` VariableRef as the string `'Kat'`<!-- -->.
