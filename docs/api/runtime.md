# runtime package

A collection of runtime utility functions

## Remarks

This package should be marked as a dependency for any package that publishes the output of [compileModule()](./core.compilemodule.md)<!-- -->, as it may be included in its ES module source output as a dependency.

For applications that bundle their output using e.g. Webpack this is not necessary.

The `Messages` accessor class is a completely optional addition. See also [@messageformat/react](./react.md) for a React-specific solution.
